# gpt-rpg

The scope of this project is to create a simple, yet powerful, role-playing game (RPG) 
engine. We will use the GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 APIs to generate the conversations between
the player and the characters in the game and also between the characters themselves.

This is just a demo project, and is not intended to be used in production.

## Installation

1. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
2. Add your OpenAI API key to the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable in your `.env` 
file, in the root of the project.

## Usage

```python main.py```
